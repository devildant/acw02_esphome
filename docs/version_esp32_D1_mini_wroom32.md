> This revision removes the traces and copper layers under the **ESP32 antenna** to potentially improve Wi-Fi signal.  
> However, since the antenna is already raised above the PCB by the pin headers, the improvement may be negligible.  
> The PCB is **ordered but not yet tested**.

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Compatibility Warning**  
  > Avoid very cheap ESP32 D1 Mini clones (often found on AliExpress).  
  > Several users reported issues with these boards.  
  > Prefer trusted brands such as **AZDelivery** or other well-reviewed suppliers.  

  **‚ùå Symptoms of low-cost ESP32 incompatibility**  
  - Wi-Fi cannot be enabled on the AC (Wi-Fi logo never appears).  
  - ESP LED turns on briefly, then shuts off.  
  - Voltage on VCC drops from 5 V to ~1.8‚Äì2 V when connected to the AC board.  

  **üõ†Ô∏è Why does this happen?**  
  Cheap ESP32 D1 Mini clones often cut corners in **power regulation** and **stability**:  
  - *Weak 5 V ‚Üí 3.3 V regulator* ‚Äî old AMS1117 regulators waste power and cannot handle Wi-Fi current peaks.  
  - *Poor decoupling capacitors* ‚Äî cheap boards lack the capacitors needed to smooth fast spikes.  
  - *Inconsistent ESP32 modules* ‚Äî some clones use non-genuine or B-grade chips.  

  **‚úÖ Why AZDelivery & trusted brands work**  
  - Use original **Espressif WROOM-32** modules.  
  - Include a **modern LDO regulator** that tolerates bursts up to 500‚Äì600 mA.  
  - Proper capacitors ensure stable operation during Wi-Fi activity.  
  - As a result, even when powered from the AC‚Äôs limited 12 V port, they stay stable and connect without issue.

  **üîç Observation**  
  By comparing ESP32 boards that work and those that don‚Äôt, I noticed visible differences.  
  If your ESP has the same configuration as in the image below (red square), it should *theoretically* be compatible.  
  It's just an observation, I don't know how to differentiate the good esp32 d1 mini cards from the bad ones, it's possible that cards with differences work
