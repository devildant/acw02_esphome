## 📋 Requirements

- Home Assistant with **MQTT integration** enabled and properly configured
- A working MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto)
- Enable the WIFI with the AC remote


## ⚙️ Settings

### 📁 Base Configuration

Open `esphome-acw02-en.yaml` or `esphome-acw02-fr.yaml` depending on your preferred language.

If you want to compile using the ESPHome Builder add-on in Home Assistant, use the files from the `HA-esphome-builder` folder instead (`ha-esphome-builder-acw02-en.yaml` or `ha-esphome-builder-acw02-fr.yaml`).

Edit the `substitutions` section — you can modify:

- `dev_name`
- `dev_friendly`
- `api_encrypted_key`
- `ota_password`
- `ap_password`
- `web_server_username`
- `web_server_password`

```yaml
substitutions:
  dev_name: acw02-salon
  dev_friendly: ACW02 salon
  lang: "en"
  api_encrypted_key: "D2oldc0VP++fni6src89tCSC0UwBhNPgyc8vgYN8/mA="
  ota_password: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD"
  ap_password: "fallbackpassword"
  web_server_username: admin
  web_server_password: admin
  board: esp32dev
```

🔑 I recommend visiting [this page](https://esphome.io/components/api.html) to generate a unique `api_encrypted_key`.

---

### 📶 Wi-Fi & Web Server Configuration

Open `secrets.yaml` and fill in your Wi-Fi credentials and desired web server access:

```yaml
wifi_ssid: "testesp32"
wifi_password: "testesp32"
wifi_ssid2: "testesp32"
wifi_password2: "testesp32"
wifi_ssid3: "testesp32"
wifi_password3: "testesp32"
```

## 🛠️ Build

- [Build on Windows (native)](docs/install_from_windows_directly.md)  
- [Build on Windows with Docker](docs/install_from_docker_win.md)
- Build with ESPHome Builder with Home Assistant add-on:  
  Use the files in the [`HA-esphome-builder`](HA-esphome-builder) folder with the Home Assistant ESPHome add-on:  
  - [`ha-esphome-builder-acw02-fr.yaml`](HA-esphome-builder/ha-esphome-builder-acw02-fr.yaml) – version française  
  - [`ha-esphome-builder-acw02-en.yaml`](HA-esphome-builder/ha-esphome-builder-acw02-en.yaml) – English version  

### 📦 Update

> **🔁 After updating:**  
> I recommend pressing the **"G1: Rebuild MQTT Entities"** button to ensure all MQTT discovery topics are refreshed properly.

  > ⚠️ **Compatibility Warning**  
  > Avoid very cheap ESP32 D1 Mini clones (often found on AliExpress).  
  > Several users reported issues with these boards.  
  > Prefer trusted brands such as **AZDelivery** or other well-reviewed suppliers.  

  **❌ Symptoms of low-cost ESP32 incompatibility**  
  - Wi-Fi cannot be enabled on the AC (Wi-Fi logo never appears).  
  - ESP LED turns on briefly, then shuts off.  
  - Voltage on VCC drops from 5 V to ~1.8–2 V when connected to the AC board.  

  **🛠️ Why does this happen?**  
  Cheap ESP32 D1 Mini clones often cut corners in **power regulation** and **stability**:  
  - *Weak 5 V → 3.3 V regulator* — old AMS1117 regulators waste power and cannot handle Wi-Fi current peaks.  
  - *Poor decoupling capacitors* — cheap boards lack the capacitors needed to smooth fast spikes.  
  - *Inconsistent ESP32 modules* — some clones use non-genuine or B-grade chips.  

  **✅ Why AZDelivery & trusted brands work**  
  - Use original **Espressif WROOM-32** modules.  
  - Include a **modern LDO regulator** that tolerates bursts up to 500–600 mA.  
  - Proper capacitors ensure stable operation during Wi-Fi activity.  
  - As a result, even when powered from the AC’s limited 12 V port, they stay stable and connect without issue.

  **🔍 Observation**  
  By comparing ESP32 boards that work and those that don’t, I noticed visible differences.  
  If your ESP has the same configuration as in the image below (red square), it should *theoretically* be compatible.  
  It's just an observation, I don't know how to differentiate the good esp32 d1 mini cards from the bad ones, it's possible that cards with differences work

## 🧱 3D Files

### 🖨️ Printing Material  

| Material | Compatible | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| PLA      | ❌ No       | Not recommended (low heat resistance) |
| PETG     | ✅ Yes (recommended) | Good balance of strength & printability |
| ABS      | ✅ Yes      | Better heat resistance |
| ASA      | ✅ Yes      | UV resistant, suitable for outdoors |
| PC       | ✅ Yes      | Very strong & heat resistant |

> ⚠️ **Why not use PLA?**  
> - PLA has a glass transition temperature of only **45–50 °C (or even lower)**.  
> - By contrast, **PETG can withstand up to ~80 °C**, making it much more reliable.  
> - For electronic components that generate heat, PLA is unsafe in warm environments — especially if your AC unit also provides **heating**.
